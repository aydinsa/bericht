<!-- Prologue start -->

The hate crime and politically motivated crime indicator includes all **criminal acts** that are **motivated by group-specific prejudices**.

It provides a way of measuring the level of **respect and tolerance** in German society.

The prejudices relate to political views, nationality, race, skin colour, religion, beliefs, appearance, disability, sexual orientation or social status and may also be directed at an institution or cause because of the same motivation. 

The data source is the Statistics on Politically Motivated Crime published by the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
