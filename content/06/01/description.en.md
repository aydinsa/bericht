The fear of crime indicator measures the **subjective sense of security** felt by people in general and with regard to specific offences. 

It describes people's fear of becoming a victim of crime themselves. 

This fear is measured using representative population surveys, here the 2012 German Victimisation Survey (*Deutscher Viktimisierungssurvey 2012*). The survey was jointly designed by the Federal Criminal Police Office (*Bundeskriminalamt*) and the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law. Respondents were asked: *"How safe do you feel in your neighbourhood at night?"* This question provides an approximnation of people's general fear of crime. The survey also measures peopleâ€™s fear of different types of criminal offences.

So far, the survey has only been carried out once, in 2012, so there is no information about changes since then. The German Victimisation Survey will be continued. The next survey is planned for 2017.
