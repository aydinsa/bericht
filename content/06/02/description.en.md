The actual crime indicator measures the **number of violent crimes and property-related crimes committed**. 

Database is the Police Crime Statistics, which releases data on all crimes known to or reported to the police through their own investigations or criminal charges. These statistics do not include data on or estimates of **non-reported crimes**. Although the Police Crime Statistics cannot provide a complete account of crime, they are a valid basis for approximating actual crime in Germany.
