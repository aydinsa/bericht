<!--Prologue start-->

Life expectancy at birth shows the average **lifespan of a newborn child**. 

Life expectancy is an established, internationally comparable indicator for the **state of health of a population**. 

The Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research and the University of California, Berkeley publish mortality data in the Human Mortality Database (HMD). The data allow for mortality rates and life expectancy to be computed consistently over time and in line with internationally comparable methods.
