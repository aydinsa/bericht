<!--Prologue start-->

The indicator shows people's **self-reported health** across a range of **income groups**. It is a proxy measure that intends to raise awareness of potential equity gaps in medical care provision.

More specifically, it shows the number of people who assess their health as "poor" or "bad", "good" or "very good" across five income groups. The data source is the **Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP)**. Each year, a sample of people aged 20 to 64 in private households are asked how they would assess their health on a 5-item scale from "bad" to "very good". For this sample of the population, the survey also collects information about their income. The individual **income position** of each person is computed based on the total distribution of income over all respondents. Available income after being adjusted for inflation, tax deductions and additional welfare payments is also referred to. Income is divided into five equally large bands, known as income quintiles, ordering income from the lowest to the highest.
The figures are statistical estimates. The upper and lower limits of the 95-per-cent-confidence-interval reflect statistical uncertainty as data are based on a randomly selected sample.
