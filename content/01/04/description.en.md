There is currently **no suitable indicator** for appropriately measuring the **quality of care**.

When people need long-term care it affects both them and their families. It may place them under great mental and physical pressure and result in a heavy financial burden. People who need long-term care understand the concept of wellbeing in different ways, largely depending on their particular limitations and individual care situation. It makes a difference whether they still live independently in their own home with occasional help from family or out-patient services, or whether they need to be in permanent in-patient care. These **different living situations** relating to people who need long-term care make it difficult to measure wellbeing in this respect. 

At present there is therefore no indicator for quality of care in this indicator system, and a **placeholder** has been used. This signals that more data is required, which could for example be gathered as part of the overhaul of the system for assessing long-term care needs.
