The employment rate is an established indicator for **participation in the labour market**. 

It describes the proportion of the workforce aged 20-64 in the population of the same age who work **at least one hour a week** in order to earn money. 

In the majority of statistics the employment rate refers to the proportion of 15-64-year-olds in the population of the same age. This adjustment of the age range is because young people between 15 and under 20 years are normally in education and therefore not available for the labour market.

The data is based on the Microcensus carried out by the Federal Statistical Office. Data on the employment rate of people with disabilities is only collected every four years, last time in 2013.
