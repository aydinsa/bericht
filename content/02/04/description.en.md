The indicator shows how employees between the ages of 20 and 64 are distributed across the various **types of employment**.

**Standard employment** is open-ended, full-time employment that does not include temporary work.

The term **non-standard employment** describes a wide range of types of employment. The Federal Statistical Office uses this term to describe workers on fixed-term contracts, those in marginal employment (mini jobs), part-time employees (up to 20 hours a week) and subcontracted and temp staff. 

These different types of non-standard employment include **duplicates**, such as when someone works less than 20 hours a week as part of a fixed-term contract. The number of people in non-standard employment is therefore lower than the total of the different types of non-standard employment.

The data was gathered by the Federal Statistical Office as part of its **Microcensus** survey.
