The job satisfaction indicator measures how **satisfied people are with their work**.

It also indirectly provides information about working conditions and a sense of doing meaningful work.

**Job satisfaction** is a complex issue. It can be measured by detailed surveys in which people evaluate their satisfaction with different aspects of their work, such as pay, enjoyment of their work, working conditions and workplace climate. Alternatively, people can be asked generally about their job satisfaction. The latter approach is used by the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), which asks people in private households aged between 20 and 54 to measure their job satisfaction on a scale of 0 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (highly satisfied). The SOEP results were used in the indicator system for this study, as a more detailed survey would go beyond the scope of this report on wellbeing in Germany.
