The old-age dependency ratio measures how many older people (67 and above) there are per 100 people of working age (20 to 66).

The indicator shows the problems that **demographic change** creates for funding the pay-as-you-go pension system.

The indicator describes the **age structure of the population**. It does not allow direct statements to be made about the sustainability of the social security system. This would require a study of the ratio of pension recipients to the actual numbers of dependent employees.

The data is based on the population forecast and the 13th coordinated population projection carried out by the Federal Statistical Office.

For future editions of this report, the federal government will present typical household and employment pattern, to show, how the goal of securing living standards in old age is achieved, what proportion of income comes from each of the three pillars of pension provision and what level of contributions this requires.
