The risk-of-poverty rate measures the **proportion of the population** whose income is **below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold**.

It shows how many people in Germany have **an income that is less than 60 per cent of the median income**.

Income is considered to be the median net household income. The **at-risk-of-poverty threshold** in 2013 was 11,800 euros per year for a single person and 24,700 euros for a household with two adults and two children under the age of 14. 

The risk-of-poverty rate is not an absolute measure of people's poverty but of their income relative to other people. So it measures **relative poverty** but not absolute poverty. In this way it provides information about income distribution in Germany. For targeted policy-making it is useful to differentiate by socio-economic group. 

As not all households that fall beneath the defined income threshold are actually suffering from **material deprivation**, this can be looked at separately. A person is considered to be materially deprived if they cannot afford to buy **certain everyday goods** that are **necessary for a minimum standard of living**. The concept for specifically calculating material deprivation from surveys of individuals and households is currently being revised. 

The data source is the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). As the indicator refers to household income, changes in household structures may influence the data over time.
