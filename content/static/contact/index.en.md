## Queries via De-Mail

De-Mail provides a verifiable and extremely secure method of electronic communication. De-Mail means that no-one can hide behind a false identity because only users whose identity has been verified can send and receive De-Mails. If you would like to send a De-Mail to the federal government's press and information office, you need to set up a De-Mail account with an approved De-Mail provider. The Press and Information Office can be contacted at the following De-Mail address: [poststelle@bpa-bund.de-mail.de](mailto:poststelle@bpa-bund.de-mail.de).
