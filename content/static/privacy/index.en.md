## Notes on data privacy

## Technical

You can access our website without disclosing your identity. Use of the website may involve the automatic processing of data. This may include the name of your service provider, IP addresses, details of your browser and operating system, websites you have visited, including search words, and sites from which you have linked to our website. In all these cases, your data is processed anonymously, i.e. the data is never assigned to a particular individual (= identifiable).

This website uses temporary cookies and JavaScript to ensure the best possible experience for our users.

Temporary cookies are tiny parcels of data that are installed on your computer's hard drive while you are visiting the website that make it easier for you to use the site. These "session cookies" are automatically removed when you leave our website. However, if you still prefer not to use cookies, you can change the settings in your browser. You can delete existing cookies on your computer by deleting temporary cookies. 

JavaScript is a program that speeds up communication. It saves your server from having to go through lengthy computing processes, meaning the website can be called up on your computer more quickly. However, some JavaScript applications may make it possible for third parties to exploit them for malicious purposes. If you do not wish to use JavaScript, you can deactivate it in your browser settings.

When you access the website, data that could potentially make it possible to identify you is stored on our servers for a maximum of 24 hours for security purposes (this may include IP address, date, time and pages visited). The IP address is then pseudonymised. It is not be used to identify the user, and no individual or pseudonymised user profiles will be created. We reserve the right to use anonymised data for statistical purposes.
