This indicator shows the **percentage of the eligible electorate** who **vote** and therefore use their right to vote. It is a way of measuring **political participation**. 

Voter turnout is a good indicator for people's interest in politics and often reflects particularly controversial political and social issues that are important at the time. In Germany there is a great deal of confidence in electoral procedures and the official results. This is helped by a transparent electoral process and independent election officials at federal and state level. The data source is the Federal Statistical Office.
