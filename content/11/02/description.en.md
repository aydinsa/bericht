This indicator shows the extent to which people feel they are able to **influence politics**. 

It provides a way of measuring whether people recognise and make use of their opportunities for co-determination. It is a **subjective indicator** based on surveys. The question about the extent to which people feel they are able to influence politics was included for the first time in the European Social Survey (ESS) in 2014. The ESS is a voluntary survey that has been carried out every two years since 2002. It studies the social and political attitudes of people in more than 30 European countries. Germany has taken part in all ESS surveys to date. In 2014 the survey involved 3,019 people, so the results can be described as **representative**.
