This indicator measures the **number of workers** (including trainees) in Germany who spend **more than 30 minutes commuting to work**.

It provides an approximation of **time flexibility**.

The information on commuting is gathered every four years in the Microcensus carried out by the Federal Statistical Office and covers different modes of transport. In 2012, almost one in five respondents did not answer the question on how long their commute to work is. This proportion increased markedly in 2012 because of changes in the questionnaire.
