This indicator measures the **share of people** who reduce or give up their employment because of care responsibilities**.

The indicator is basically designed to illustrate the issue of **work-life balance**. Since 2013, it shows whether people have reduced or given up work because of care responsibilities.

It would be useful to collect more precise data on the amount of part-time work, because it makes a difference whether someone reduces their working hours from full-time to 20 or 5 hours a week. It would also be useful to make the questions on reducing or giving up work compulsory questions in the Microcensus carried out by the Federal Statistical Office in order to improve the database.
