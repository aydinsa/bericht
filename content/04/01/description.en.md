This indicator compares whether people's **preferred working hours** differ from their** actual working hours**.

It is a proxy to measure the **work-life balance**.

Working hours means the average number of hours worked. The data refers to **employees aged 20-54** (excluding trainees) but including interns. People who actually work less than five hours a week and with desired regular working hours of more than 60 hours have been excluded.

The data source is the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The data on desired, agreed and actual working hours was collected in surveys, which means the values presented are only statistical approximations.
