This indicator represents the ratio of **children who are looked after** in childcare centres or by nannies and the total number of children in a given age group.

It provides a way of assessing the quality of the infrastructure for families and for achieving a good work-life balance.

The **full-time childcare enrolment rate** measures the share of children who are looked after in day care facilities for at least seven hours on weekdays, whether in publicly subsidised day care, after-school clubs or all-day schools.

Care rates do not provide information about quality of care, whether there is a need for additional care, and if so how much.
