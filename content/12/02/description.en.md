Public expenditure on development cooperation as a percentage of gross national income (ODA rate) measures **Germany's financial contribution to development worldwide**.

It is a way of measuring Germany's involvement in combating poverty and promoting security and peace. The ODA rate shows Germany's expenditure on **financial, technical and humanitarian cooperation** with developing countries and its contribution to **multilateral development institutions and funds** such as the United Nations and World Bank. For example, the ODA rate includes paying for students from developing countries to attend German universities. It is measured in accordance with international rules (set at OECD level).
