This indicator measures **global and national greenhouse gas emissions** and records changes in the area of climate protection. 


**Greenhouse gases** include CO<sub>2</sub>, methane and nitrous oxide. They are **produced** by burning coal, oil and gas, and also through deforestation, agriculture and other emissions such as refrigerants in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are given in **CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>eq)**, which are then calculated using the IPCC's AR4 standard in accordance with their potential to create global warming. Global emissions data is based on a number of **estimates and projections** for each country and emission source, coordinated by the EU's Joint Research Centre. In Germany the data source is the Federal Environmental Agency (*Umweltbundesamt*).
