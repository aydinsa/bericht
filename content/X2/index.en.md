## Orientation towards citizens' viewpoints

With its "Wellbeing in Germany – what matters to us" initiative, the federal government is turning its attention to the issue of wellbeing. In order to do this, it is important to develop a sound understanding of **German citizens' perspectives on wellbeing**. So the government initiative started with a six-month consultation process involving interested citizens.


## Dialogue events throughout the country

In order to hear as many opinions as possible on the issue of wellbeing, the German government asked for the help of a **large number of social groups**. The main aim was to ensure diversity. Invitations were sent to a wide range of clubs and associations throughout Germany, asking them to get involved in the national dialogue on "Wellbeing in Germany – what matters to us" by organising events. They included the *Bundeswehr-Sozialwerk* (charitable organisation for members of the German army), the *Arbeiterwohlfahrt* (Workers' Welfare Association), various unions, the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the *Deutscher LandFrauenverband* (Women's agricultural association). A number of churches and religious groups also got actively involved, along with many adult education centres (*Volkshochschulen*) throughout Germany. At the [**launch of the dialogue phase in Berlin on 13 April 2015**](https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/AudioVideo/2015/Video/Buergerdialog/2015-04-13-buergerdialog-auftakt/2015-04-13-buergerdialog-auftakt.html) Chancellor Angela Merkel and Minister Sigmar Gabriel welcomed organisers from throughout Germany.

## More than 200 national dialogue events nationwide

Thanks to strong public interest, [**203 national dialogue events**](https://www.gut-leben-in-deutschland.de/SiteGlobals/PL/26373870) took place between April and October 2015 in every region of Germany, including large cities and small rural communities. The Chancellor and federal ministers were invited to 50 events to discuss aspects of wellbeing with citizens.

# Online dialogue and postcard campaign

Anyone who was not able to attend a national dialogue event could still take part online on the [national dialogue website](https://www.gut-leben-in-deutschland.de/SiteGlobals/PL/28928699) or via postcard.

A total of **15,750 people** took part in the national dialogue. Their contributions provided a wide-ranging picture of social priorities and political challenges for Germany. This result is **not representative** in scientific terms, but it is **diverse, specific and meaningful**.

## Independent scientific analysis of the dialogue

An **independent team of scientists** analysed the national dialogue and the online and written opinions of citizens on wellbeing. This was done using a combination of established scientific methods and innovative text analysis software. This ensured that all the issues and aspects of wellbeing discussed in the dialogue were collated in a detailed, differentiated way and organised and described as objectively as possible.

## Scientific advisory board

The overall government strategy on "Wellbeing in Germany – what matters to us" was accompanied by an **independent scientific advisory board**.

The [scientific advisory board](https://www.gut-leben-in-deutschland.de/SiteGlobals/PL/27938301) was made up of the following members:

Dr Stefan Bergheim of the Centre for Societal Progress in Frankfurt am Main;
Dr Heinz-Herbert Noll, of the former Social Indicators Research Centre at the GESIS Institute for Social Sciences in Mannheim;
Professor Dr Christoph M. Schmidt of the RWI - Leibniz-Institute for Economic Research in Essen;
Dr Susanne Schnorr-Bäcker of the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden;
Professor Dr Gert G. Wagner of the Berlin University of Technology;
Professor Dr Sabine Walper of the German Youth Institute in Munich.

The federal government has sole responsibility for selecting the dimensions and indicators as well as for the report on wellbeing.

## Key results

Almost 400 different topics and aspects relating to wellbeing were addressed and discussed in the national dialogue. The following aspects of wellbeing were mentioned particularly often:
