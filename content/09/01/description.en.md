The real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita indicator measures the **total value of all goods and services** that are produced in an economy per capita.

GDP is an internationally recognised way of measuring material prosperity and the strength of a country's economy. 

It is often given as a per capita figure so that it is easier to make comparisons between rural and urban areas and between countries with high and low population densities. The percentage change in GDP is known as **economic growth**.
It is adjusted for inflation, here based on 2010 prices. The data is based on the National Accounts produced by the Federal Statistical Office.
