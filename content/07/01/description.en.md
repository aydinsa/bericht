This indicator shows **rental costs** as a **proportion of net household income**.

It provides an indication of the **affordability of housing**.

This indicator only applies to households who live in rented accommodation. It provides information on the average proportion of monthly disposable household income that households spend on their rented accommodation, including heating and hot water. Net household income also includes housing benefit and basic benefits.

The data source is the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). As the indicator refers to household income, changes in household structures may influence the data over time.
