<!-- Prologue start -->

The broadband access indicator measures the **proportion of households** that have access to **internet speeds of at least 50 Mbit/s**.

It is a measure for **participation in digitisation**.

The data from the Broadband Atlas closes a serious gap in the information on households and companies for expanding the network in Germany. The broadband atlas is based on data supplied voluntarily by some 340 broadband providers, which are constantly updated. The focus is on the availability of download speeds for **private households**. Since 2015, data has also been gathered on broadband availability for businesses.

The Broadband Atlas in its smallest resolution only includes regions in which people or companies are actually registered in accordance with the official data of the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG). Therefore, it takes some time for new development areas in particular to be included. The increased connectivity of public authorities and use of interfaces will speed up updates to this data.
