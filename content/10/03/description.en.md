This indicator shows the relationship between **gross domestic product (GDP) and energy consumption**. It shows how **efficiently energy resources are being used**.

This indicator specifically measures how many monetary units of economic output (in euros, price-adjusted) are produced for each unit of primary energy consumption (mainly in petajoules) used. It shows changes in energy productivity as compared to the reference year of 1990.

It is the established measure for energy efficiency. The data source is the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Energiebilanzen e.V. and the Federal Statistical Office.
